Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built this because I was tired of the copy-paste dance every time I needed AI help with a GitHub issue.

The problem: You open an issue, then spend 5 minutes copying the title, description, error logs, relevant comments... formatting it nicely... only to realize you forgot the reproduction steps.

The solution: One click. That's it.

What it does:
• Automatically extracts everything relevant from GitHub issues
• Offers 6 built-in templates (Bug Fix, Feature Request, Code Review, etc.)
• Optional AI-powered prompt generation using GPT models
• Create your own custom templates
• Works with Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant

Technical details for the curious:
• Manifest V3 Chrome extension
• Your API key stays local (privacy-first)
• Fully open source

I'd love your feedback! What templates would you find most useful?

## Media Assets

### Thumbnail (240x240 recommended)
Use the extension icon or create a custom thumbnail with:
- GitHub logo + AI/sparkle icon
- Text: "Issue → AI Prompt"

### Gallery Images (1270x760 recommended)
1. **Hero Image**: Show the popup with a real GitHub issue converted to prompt
2. **Feature Overview**: Annotated screenshot showing key features
3. **Settings Page**: Show the customization options
4. **Before/After**: Side-by-side of manual vs. extension workflow

### GIF Demo (Highly Recommended)
Create a 10-15 second GIF showing:
1. Navigate to GitHub issue
2. Click extension
3. See prompt appear
4. Click copy
